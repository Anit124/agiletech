The OBC Morcha aims to connect with the backward classes across the country and help create awareness of their rights, besides empowering them.In 2018 Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s government gave the constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) despite the fact that there was resistance from the opposition parties. The National Commission for Backward Classes, which is a statutory body created in 1993, was given limited powers, only to recommend to the Government inclusion or exclusion of a community in the central list of the OBCs</p>

                                        The rise of the BJP OBC front took place at the all India level in 2015 under the government of respected <strong>PM Narendra damodardas Modi ji.</strong>

Bharatiya Janata Party took many historic decisions since 2015, in which the most important decision was the permanent structure of this organization, whose goal is vested politics, self-fulfillment, not the goal of becoming one-sided in politics.

                                        For the welfare of the backward classes, many people thought of the movement, even though they did not belong to the backward classes, but their movement was limited to caste vested interests and a couple of families, but to take that movement out, to reach the masses. The work was done by the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Bharatiya Janata Party is the only party in the country, whose basic principle is the concept of excellence for the backward classes, whose excellent example BJP gave the country the first OBC Prime Minister Narendra Bhai Modi, BJP gave the maximum number of OBC Chief Ministers. The political parties that run the party in the name of the family question the intention of the BJP for the OBC class, look at the participation of OBC ministers in the government.

                                        This is a social harmony, social efficiency, otherwise it is unfortunate that even after 60 years of independence, the backward class is in front of the society, If the country is to be made a Vishwaguru, then this class has to be brought up first because without this class the creation of the society of the country cannot be imagined. This front will prove to be the backbone of the country, no one should have any doubt about it.
